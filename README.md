# Gameboy/Game Boy Color for Analogue Pocket
Ported from the original core developed at https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Gameboy_MiSTer

Please report any issues encountered to this repo. Issues will be upstreamed as necessary.

## Installation
To install the core, copy the `Assets`, `Cores`, and `Platform` folders over to the root of your SD card. Please note that Finder on macOS automatically _replaces_ folders, rather than merging them like Windows does, so you have to manually merge the folders.

Place the GBC bios in `/Assets/gbc/common` named "gbc_bios.bin", and the GB bios in `/Assets/gb/common` named "gb_bios.bin".


## Usage
ROMs should be placed in `/Assets/gbc/common`, and `/Assets/gb/common`

### Supported
* Real-Time Clock
* Fastforward
* Original Gameboy display modes
* Super Gameboy Emulation
