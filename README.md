# Gameboy/Game Boy Color for Analogue Pocket Core with support for Analogizer-FPGA adapter
* Analogizer V1.0.0 [26/11/2024]: Added initial support for Analogizer adapter (RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C, SVGA Scandoubler) and SNAC (included PSX DS/DS2). The PSX DS/DS2
  can be used in **Digital DPAD** mode (ignores the analog sticks, regardless of the ANALOG button setting on the controller) or in **Analog DPAD** mode (left analog stick is mapped to DPAD movements)

Adapted to Analogizer by [@RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII) based on **budude2** Gameboy/Game Boy Color for Analogue Pocket (https://github.com/budude2/openfpga-GBC).
The core can output RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C and SVGA scandoubler(0%, 25%, 50% 75% scanlines and HQ2x) video signals. 
This core has an additional **```Analog Wide```** setting which allows to increase the horizontal size of the image on the CRT/SVGA monitor.

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:
```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
```

# Gameboy/Game Boy Color for Analogue Pocket
Ported from the original core developed at https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Gameboy_MiSTer

Please report any issues encountered to this repo. Issues will be upstreamed as necessary.

## Installation
To install the core, copy the `Assets`, `Cores`, and `Platform` folders over to the root of your SD card. Please note that Finder on macOS automatically _replaces_ folders, rather than merging them like Windows does, so you have to manually merge the folders.

Place the GBC bios in `/Assets/gbc/common` named "gbc_bios.bin", the GB bios in `/Assets/gb/common` named "gb_bios.bin", and the SGB bios in `/Assets/gb/common` named "sgb_boot.bin".


## Usage
ROMs should be placed in `/Assets/gbc/common`, and `/Assets/gb/common`

## Features

### Supported
* Real-Time Clock
* Fastforward
* Original Gameboy display modes
* Super Gameboy Emulation
* Custom Borders (SGB)
* Custom Palettes (SGB)
* Enhance GBA features
* Save States and Sleep

### In Progress
